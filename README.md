# HOME DETECTION LAB
Objective

This Home Detection Lab is aimed to understand how SIEM systems collect and analyze security data from various sources to detect and respond to potential security threats.
The primary focus was to learn how to integrate various security technologies and customize the SIEM environment to meet specific security monitoring needs and requirements.

Skills Learned

<ul>
  <li>Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application</li>
  <li>Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs</li>
  <li>Practice investigating and responding to simulated security events</li>
  <li>Configure and optimize Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fleet for efficient log analysis</li>
</ul>

Tools Used
<ul>
  <li><strong>Elasticsearch</strong> - For storing and analyzing log data.</li>
  <li><strong>Kibana</strong> - For visualizing Elasticsearch data and creating dashboards.</li>
  <li><strong>Elastic Stack (ELK Stack)</strong> - The combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana used for log management and analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Elastic Agent</strong> - To collect logs and metrics from endpoints for monitoring and security.</li>
  <li><strong>Fleet</strong> - To manage the Elastic Agents at scale across the home lab environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Elastic Defend</strong> - Added integration for threat detection, investigation, and response within the Elastic Stack.</li>
  <li><strong>Kali Linux</strong> - Booted to VirtualBox VM to launch and monitor SIEM Lab.</li>
